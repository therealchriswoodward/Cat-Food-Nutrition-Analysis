## Project

My cat has extreme diabetes and my wife and I were looking for foods we could afford to feed him as glucose management is very important. She showed me this data set and asked what insights I could gain from it to help us, so this little project came to life.

There aren't any visualizations in this analysis as they aren't necessary. There are some tables, an executive summary, and a findings report. The tables and all findings are in the report.
